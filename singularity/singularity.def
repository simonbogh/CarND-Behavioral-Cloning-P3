# This scriptlet will be run from inside the container.
# This is where the guts of your setup will live, including

%post
    # Clone a git repo
    # Here we are at the base, /, of the container
    # echo "Cloning repo"
    # git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi.git

    # Install Python packages
    echo "Installing Python dependencies"
    pip install eventlet Flask h5py imageio Keras matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-image scikit-learn scipy seaborn tornado
